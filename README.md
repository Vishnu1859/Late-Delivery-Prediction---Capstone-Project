The capstone project, titled "Late Delivery Risk Prediction Using Classification Techniques," addresses the critical issue of inconsistent delivery predictions in the E-Commerce realm. Utilizing the "DataCo SMART SUPPLY CHAIN FOR BIG DATA ANALYSIS" dataset, the project employs a robust methodology involving missing value and outlier treatment, exploratory data analysis, and strategic feature engineering. Model development explores various classifiers, ultimately selecting a logical model leveraging a decision tree with a bagging classifier. Rigorous experimentation and hyperparameter tuning result in a final model with 99% accuracy on the train set and 94% on the test set. The project not only provides a practically applicable solution but also contributes to enhancing predictive capabilities in late delivery risk prediction for E-Commerce. Future research avenues may explore additional features and refinements to further improve the model's accuracy and reliability.
